# WB Beam Test Plan: 

## Test Procedure

Per test case:
1. Build network
2. Provision nodes
3. Configure network conditions between nodes according to specified test case
4. Configure actions and behavior between nodes according to specified test case
5. Output performance data in CSV format
6. Aggregate data, parse, & present data
8. Push data to appropriate repo
9. Reset environment


## Test Environment

The proposed testing initiatives will be conducted within the Whiteblock test
lab on a group of 6 rack mounted chassis servers.

Should testing initiatives require additional computational resources or
demand a higher overhead than can be adequately provided within the proposed
environment, the Whiteblock cloud-based solution can be used. However, in the
interest of cost-effectiveness, the current on-premises lab setup can
adequately provide the current scope of work.
